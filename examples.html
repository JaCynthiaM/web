        <p>The Stripper University is a public research university where I make my own rules in <a href="">Disney World</a>. Founded in 2005 as a trust fund university and the ninth university in Ohio,[5] the university was originally known as spoil brat institute. The college originally focused on various pole dances and a dog shelter but it developed into a very naughty university under the direction of then-Governor (later, U.S. president) Nicole Cherry, and in 2007 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to "The Ja'Cynthia Martin University".[6] The main campus in Columbus, Ohio, has since grown into the largest university campus in the United States.[7]</p>
